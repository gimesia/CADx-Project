# Analysis of Differences between Binary and Multiclass Feature Importances

Examining the feature importance for binary classification (distinguishing between nevus and lesion) versus multiclass classification (distinguishing between melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma) reveals some key distinctions. These differences provide insights into which features are most effective for simpler binary separation versus more nuanced multiclass differentiation.

## Key Differences in Feature Importances

1. **Color Moments Emphasis in Binary Classification**
   - In the binary classification, **color moments** (like `color_moments_lab_A_min`, `color_moments_rgb_B_var`, and `color_moments_hsv_S_min`) are especially dominant. This suggests that **color distribution and variability** are primary indicators when separating benign nevus from potentially malignant lesions.
   - In the multiclass task, however, **color moments remain important** but are not as dominant compared to texture-based features. This suggests that while color is important, it alone is not sufficient to distinguish between melanoma, basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), which have more subtle textural and structural differences.

2. **Increased Importance of Texture Features (LBP, FFT, and GLCM) in Multiclass**
   - In the multiclass classification, **texture features** such as Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and Fourier Transform (FFT) features take on a higher role.
   - The multiclass setting requires distinguishing between the distinct **texture profiles** of melanoma, BCC, and SCC. Melanoma often has irregular, complex textures; BCC might show smooth, rolled borders; and SCC may have scaly or rough textures. These differences are better captured by texture features rather than color alone.
   - GLCM features, which analyze spatial relationships, are also more relevant in multiclass classification, capturing texture uniformity differences across lesion types. In binary classification, spatial relationships are less crucial, as color and general texture (smooth vs. irregular) are more definitive.

3. **Edge and Gradient Importance Differences**
   - **Gradient features** (such as `gradient_magnitude_std`) appear in both classifications but play a more supportive role in the multiclass setting.
   - In binary classification, gradient variability is useful for identifying the **irregular borders** common in malignant lesions compared to smoother nevus borders.
   - In multiclass classification, boundary irregularity alone isnâ€™t sufficient since all three cancer types (melanoma, BCC, and SCC) can present irregular edges, so other features like color and texture complexity become more essential.

## Conclusions

- **Binary Classification** relies heavily on high-level color and general texture differences. Since the task is primarily separating benign from malignant potential, color variations and broad textural cues (smoothness vs. irregularity) are sufficient.
- **Multiclass Classification** requires more nuanced texture analysis. Texture features such as FFT and LBP capture the finer patterns needed to distinguish between different types of cancerous lesions, which may have similar color characteristics but differ in structural detail and spatial uniformity.

This analysis highlights that **texture features provide the specificity needed in complex classifications**, while **color and general texture features** are often sufficient for simpler binary tasks.
