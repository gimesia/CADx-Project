# Melanoma Classification
This repository implements deep learning approaches for melanoma classification. It supports:

**Binary classification:** Differentiating nevus from other cases.
**Multiclass classification:** Identifying melanoma, nevus, and other skin conditions.
The project leverages state-of-the-art neural network architectures and focuses on robust feature extraction to improve diagnostic accuracy.
